    <h3>Here's how to hire an exterior house painter in the Okanagan:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Get a referral. </strong>Ask your friends and family which painter they've hired in the past, and what their experience was.</li>
      <li><strong>Call around!</strong> It's a good idea to get 3 different quotes before starting your painting project. You can call Dave first at 250-306-9121.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask for an estimate. </strong>Clearly define your project: &quot;we'd like the exterior of our house painted. It has wood siding.&quot; Ask the painter to come to your home, and provide an estimate. It's a good idea for you to be present during the assessment, so you can ask questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask for references</strong>. Before you hire a painter, ask them for references. Call those people! You want to make sure that your painter is experienced.</li>
      <li><strong>Clearly communicate expectations.</strong> You should have an agreement with the painter you hire that answers these questions: when will they start? When will the project be complete? What hours will they work? What is the total cost? What type (and color) of paint will they use?</li>
    </ol>
